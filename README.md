# Project Name

- Awesome Book

## Description of the project.

- In this project, we built a basic website that allows users to add/remove books from a list. We achieve that by using JavaScript objects and arrays, dynamically modify the DOM and add basic events.

Below is the summary of this project:

- Created a collection that keeps a list of books
- dCreate a function to add a new book to the collection, with title and author.
- Created a function to remove a book from the collection
- Display all books saved in the collection in the top part of the page.
- Made sure that when a user clicks the "Add" button:
  A new book is added to the collection.
  The new book is displayed in the page.
- Made sure that when a user clicks the "Remove" button:
  The correct book is removed from the collection.
  The correct book dissapears from the page.
- Made sure that data is preserved in the browser's memory by using localStorage.
